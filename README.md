This job was done as a test task while applying to a front-end developer vacancy.

This is front-end part of the Email Tracking App. It allows to convert actual email text into email tracking HTML content. Resulting email contains tracking pixel and links converted to be trackable. Also there's preview area for the tracking email that appears after convertion is done and is being updated after reconvertion.

Unfortunately, the app can't be fully tested because the backend part is restricted for public use. Open index.html of the "dist" directory in your browser to launch.
