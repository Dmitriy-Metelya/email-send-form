This is front-end part off the Email Tracking App. It allows to convert actual email text into email tracking HTML content. Resulting email consisits of tracking pixel and links converted to be trackable. Also there's preview area for the tracking email that appears after convertion is done.

Unfortunately, the app can't be launched because the backend part is restricted for public use.
